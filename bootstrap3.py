    bootstrap.py
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~

    This simple command line script will 'bootstrap' this simple Flask
    application by performing a few simple tasks:

    - It will collect your Stormpath credentials from you (via the command
      line).

    - It will get or create a new Stormpath Application in your account named
      (so that we can run this project).

    - It will create a `.env` file in this directory which holds 3 environment
      variables needed for this sample application to run successfully.

    - Lastly, it will tell you how to run this website!

Now that we've completed all bootstrapping stuff, all you need to do to get
your sample application running is to execute the following commands:

    $ source .env
    $ python app.py

You should then be able to visit 'http://localhost:5000' in your browser to
play around with the sample application!
